# Spreadsheet Application (Excel Clone)
Developed a fully functional spreadsheet web application that mimics core features of Microsoft Excel. The
application supports multiple sheets, rich text formatting, cell-based formula computations, dependency
graph tracking, and cycle detection in formula references. Key features include:
◦ Cell Formatting: Bold, italic, underline, font size, font family, text and background color customizations.
◦ Formula Support: Custom formula input with live evaluation, dependency graph generation, and cycle
detection to prevent infinite loops.
◦ Multiple Sheets Handling: Users can add, switch, and remove multiple sheets with individual data
contexts.
◦ Data Persistence: Implemented file-based open/save functionality using JSON for exporting and importing sheet data.
◦ Cut/Copy/Paste Logic: Allows efficient cell data duplication and transfer.
◦ Responsive UI: Clean and intuitive interface using vanilla CSS with scrollable grid, address bars, and
formula bars
